# json_generator_tft_champs
A small program that generates a json file to be used by the tft AI

generates:

- Name of champion which encapsulates the following;
- Priority score of champion (PS) through number 1-5  (1 == lowest 5 == highest)
- Items - three complete items that the champion is using
- Sub items - components of major items that the champion needs
- Traits - three traits that the champion has (if champion has two traits simply type "0" to the third)
- Update:
- Role - assign a role which will be used to determine the position of the champion on the board
- Revamped to use numbers instead of text input to minimize human error while typing

**The meaning of the numbers can be found under data/numbers_and_meaning.txt**
