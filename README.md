# json_generator_tft_champs
a small program that generates a json file to be used by the tft AI

generates:

- name of champion which encapsulates the following
- priority score of champion (PS) through number 1-5  (1 == lowest 5 == highest)
- items - three complete items that the champion is using
- sub items - components of major items that the champion needs
- traits - three traits that the champion has (if champion has two traits simply type "0" to the third)
- Update:
- role - assign a role which will be used to determine the position of the champion on the board
- revamped to use numbers instead of text input to minimize human error while typing

Numbers can be found under data/numbers_and_meaning.txt
